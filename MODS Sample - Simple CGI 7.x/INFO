description="This is a package created with MODS to illustrate the use of a fake CGI that runs a simple php website, displayed in a DSM iFrame. It requires dependency neither on the well known package Init_3rdparty not on the Synology WebStation. it reuses the 'Simple php Website' of Banago for illustration purpose. Navigation between pages can be tested as well asAjax calls, Ajax callbacks, Post and Get. This version is targeting DSM 7.x. Due to security restriction during installation, it requires an access onto the NAS via SSH. Credentials of an administrator must be entered (at your own risk) to autorize the execution of commands as sudoer. This is indeed required to configure nginx and run php pages deployed outside the root folder of the WebStation."
