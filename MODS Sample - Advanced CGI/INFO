description="Example of package written in PHP to show the 'Hello World' message without any dependency on the package INIT_3rdparty (used to run PHP scripts not located under the default www root folder). This package depends however on the Web Station as it illustrates also how one can access the PHP scripts via the port 80 of the Webstation (using symbolink links - A PHP profile must be configured in the General Settings or the Web Station). This is based on the excellent post of Rob Van Aarle explaining how to use a simple CGI/Bash to execute a php page (see http://www.robvanaarle.com/blog/2014/08/embedded-php-app-without-dependencies-for-synology-nas/)"
